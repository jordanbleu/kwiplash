Type a witty response to the prompt and click the submit button.

No more than 8 players may join a single round, but anyone can vote for responses!

## Voting

After 45 seconds, the Kwiplash bot will send another message asking for votes.  Each player's response will be laid out anonymously for others to vote on.  

You can not vote for yourself, and you only get one vote.  Clicking multiple buttons will simply update your vote.
