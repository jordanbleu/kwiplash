    "Can you all please try to be more opinionated?",
    "A tie means none of you win :(",
    "So many winners!",
    "Wow...maybe you should try voting so someone can actually win.",
    "I'm so angry that there's a tie.",
    "So many winners in this round!", 
    "Arghhh I hate ties!",
    "Normally there's only supposed to be one winner but I guess that's fine.",
    "Oh...a tie?  Maybe we should try playing again.",
    "Nice tie!",
    "You're all so smart that there are multiple winners!",
    "It was so hard to pick a winner, you were all so great ðŸ˜˜",
    "A TIE?????  What the hell is wrong with you all?",
    "Okay that second one was good but the rest are stupid.",
    "The first one was great but all the others were terrible.",
    "I'm just a discord bot so my vote doesn't really count but personally I'd pick the second one.",
    "Lol, why would you vote for that first one?  What a dumb response.", 
    "The second one is amazing, I laughed so hard.",
    "That is too many winners.  I don't like that.",
    "Can we try to just pick one winner next time?  Seriously.",
    "Why did you all vote for so many people."
